When pensions sell the future, we must build it

PROBLEM
The pension fund redemption problem occurs when underfunded pensions must sell assets to pay retirees, risking losses and worsening underfunding.

Example: A pension with $100 in assets and $150 in liabilities (67% funded) sells $20 worth of assets at a 10% loss to pay retirees, receiving only $18. After payment, assets drop to $82 and liabilities to $130, reducing the funding ratio to 63%.

SOLUTION
yield-bearing collateral
